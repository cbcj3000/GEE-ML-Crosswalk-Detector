# GEE-ML-Crosswalk-Detector
Using Google Earth Engine I created a script that finds crosswalks located in New York City. It detects the crosswalks in GEE, retrieves their longitude and latitude. Then that data is put into a csv that I then download and convert into a js file. Then I use the js file to show the data on a map I created using Esri. To see more detailed instructions go to the Instructions file.
